# Wine-Clustering
# Overview
This Machine Learning project focuses on clustering wine data to identify distinct groups of wines with similar characteristics. The model helps in understanding the underlying patterns in wine attributes, which can be valuable for wine quality assessment and recommendation.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains various attributes of wines, such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, and color intensity. The goal is to cluster the wines into groups based on these features.

Wine clustering can assist in wine quality assessment and improve recommendations for consumers by identifying similarities in wine profiles.

## What Input Data is Required?

The model takes the following attributes as input:

1. **Alcohol**
2. **Malic Acid**
3. **Ash**
4. **Alcalinity of Ash**
5. **Magnesium**
6. **Total Phenols**
7. **Flavanoids**
8. **Nonflavanoid Phenols**
9. **Proanthocyanins**
10. **Color Intensity**
11. **Hue**
12. **OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines**
13. **Proline**

# How to Upload Data for Prediction?
Go to the Website. There are two options for uploading data for clustering:

Manual Entry: Suitable for single instance clustering via sliders and text fields.
CSV File Upload: Suitable for clustering multiple instances at once. Upload a .csv file in the specified format.
